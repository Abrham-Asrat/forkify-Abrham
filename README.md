# 🍕Forkify Project

A JavaScript application for searching and bookmarking recipes from the [Forkify API](https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/), built as part of Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course on Udemy.

## 📽Project Overview

Forkify is a single-page application (SPA) that allows users to search for recipes, view details of selected recipes, and save their favorite recipes for later. This project is built with Vanilla JavaScript and leverages the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.

## ✨Features

- **🔍Search Recipes**: Find recipes by keyword from the Forkify API.
- **📖Recipe Details**: View ingredients, servings, and instructions.
- **❤️Bookmark Recipes**: Save favorite recipes for quick access.
- **🍽️Adjust Servings**: Dynamically update ingredient quantities based on the number of servings.
- **➕Add Custom Recipes**: Users can add their own recipes to the app.
- **💾Persistent Bookmarks**: Bookmarks are saved in local storage, so they persist even after refreshing the page.
